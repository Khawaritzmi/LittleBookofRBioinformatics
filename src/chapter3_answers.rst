Answers to the exercises on Sequence Databases
==============================================   

Q1. *What information about the DEN-1 Dengue virus sequence (NCBI accession NC\_001477) can you obtain from its annotations in the NCBI Sequence Database?*

To do this, you need to go to the `www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov>`_ website 
and type the DEN-1 Dengue virus genome sequence accession (NC\_001477) in the search box, and press 'Search'. 

On the search results page, you should see '1' beside the word 'Nucleotide', meaning that there was one hit to a sequence record in the NCBI Nucleotide database, which contains DNA and RNA sequences. If you click on the word 'Nucleotide', it will bring you to the sequence record, which should be the NCBI sequence record for the DEN-1 Dengue virus' genome (ie. for accession NC\_001477). 
	
On the webpage for the NCBI sequence record for the DEN-1 Dengue virus' genome (webpage http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_001477) , you will see in the DEFINITION, ORGANISM and REFERENCE fields of its NCBI record: 

DEFINITION: Dengue virus type 1, complete genome.
ORGANISM: Dengue virus 1
REFERENCE: There are several papers (the first is):
AUTHORS: Puri,B., Nelson,W.M., Henchal,E.A., Hoke,C.H., Eckels,K.H., Dubois,D.R., Porter,K.R. and Hayes,C.G.
TITLE: Molecular analysis of dengue virus attenuation after serial passage in primary dog kidney cells
JOURNAL: J. Gen. Virol. 78 (PT 9), 2287-2291 (1997)

There are also some other references, for papers published about the Dengue virus genome sequence.
