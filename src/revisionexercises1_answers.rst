Answers to Revision Exercises 1
===============================   

Q1. *What is the length of (total number of base-pairs in) the Schistosoma mansoni mitochondrial genome
(NCBI accession NC\_002545), and how many As, Cs, Gs and Ts does it contain?*

Q2. *What is the length of the Brugia malayi mitochondrial genome (NCBI accession NC\_004298),
and how many As, Cs, Gs and Ts does it contain?* 

Q3. *What is the probability of the Brugia malayi mitochondrial genome sequence (NCBI accession NC\_004298), 
according to a multinomial model in which the probabilities of As, Cs, Gs and Ts (pA, pC, pG, and pT) 
are set equal to the fraction of As, Cs, Gs and Ts in the Schistosoma mansoni mitochondrial genome?*

Q4. *What are the top three most frequent 4-bp words (4-mers) in the genome of the
bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis strain D/UW-3/CX (NCBI accession NC\_000117), and
how many times do they occur in its sequence?*

Q5. *Write an R function to generate a random DNA sequence that is n letters long (that is, 
n bases long) using a multinomial model in which the probabilities pA, pC, pG, 
and pT are set equal to the fraction of As, Cs, Gs and Ts in the Schistosoma mansoni
mitochondrial genome.*

Q6. *Give an example of using your function from Q5 to calculate a random sequence that is 20 letters 
long, using a multinomial model with pA =0.28, pC =0.21, pG =0.22, and pT =0.29.*

Q7. *How many protein sequences from rabies virus are there in the NCBI Protein database?*

Q8. *What is the NCBI accession for the Mokola virus genome?*
